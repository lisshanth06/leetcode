## Problem Statement

Given a string s containing just the characters &#39;(&#39;, &#39;)&#39;, &#39;{&#39;, &#39;}&#39;, &#39;[&#39; and &#39;]&#39;, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

	Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
	Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
	Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"

Output: true

Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"

Output: false

Example 4:

Input: s = "([])"

Output: true

Example 5:

Input: s = "([)]"

Output: false

Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 104
	s consists of parentheses only &#39;()[]{}&#39;.
